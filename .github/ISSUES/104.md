# Add support to Open Tofu

**matihost** commented *Oct 13, 2023*

Either

1)add "tofu-*" equivalents for existing hooks "terraform-*" 
2) or rename "terraform-*" to for example "tf-*" and autodetect whether tofu is present 

For example:
Rename:
terraform-validate
to 
tf-validate

and detect tofu or  terraform binary similarly like terragrunt does it today.
