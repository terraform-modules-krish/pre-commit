# Golint is deprecated; the hook should be replaced accordingly

**infraredgirl** commented *Feb 17, 2022*

Golint is apparently [deprecated and frozen](https://github.com/golang/lint). We should replace the pre-commit hook with another linting tool for Go. The Golint GitHub page itself recommends https://staticcheck.io/.
