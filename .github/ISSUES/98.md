# Linting for Comment Blocks

**rdtechie** commented *May 12, 2023*

I'm curious, does Gruntwork uses linting to ensure comment blocks as explained here?
https://docs.gruntwork.io/guides/style/terraform-style-guide/#comments

I'm trying to find a linting tool to check for this but till now I haven't found something yet.
