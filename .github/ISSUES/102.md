**Describe the bug**
We utilize a monorepo for our terraform configurations and we have integrated into our CI pipline precommit checks with the tflint precommit plugin.  What I've noticed is that ever since the release of chdir my `.tflint.hcl` file is no longer effective.  It looks like because tflint is actually changing the current working directory (https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/0e58cd19e334b6c1edfc4ba6d9f4778a28a3342e/cmd/inspect.go#L35C20-L35C20 and https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/0e58cd19e334b6c1edfc4ba6d9f4778a28a3342e/cmd/cli.go#L178) and then loading the config file (https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/0e58cd19e334b6c1edfc4ba6d9f4778a28a3342e/cmd/inspect.go#L110).  The result is tflint failing on rules that I've called out as disabled in my base .tflint.hcl file.

**To Reproduce**
```bash
mkdir -pv tflint-demo/module
pushd tflint-demo >/dev/null
git init

cat <<EOF > .pre-commit-config.yaml
---
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit
    rev: v0.1.22
    hooks:
    - id: terragrunt-hclfmt
    - id: tflint
      args:
        - "--config=.tflint.hcl"
EOF

cat <<EOF > .tflint.hcl
rule "terraform_required_providers" {
  enabled = false
}
EOF

pushd module >/dev/null

cat <<EOF > main.tf
resource "null_resource" "foo" {
  triggers = {
    "coffee" = "sandwich"
  }
}
EOF

popd >/dev/null

git add .
pre-commit install
pre-commit run
```

**Expected behavior**
I'd expect the .tflint.hcl file to be honored from the repo root directory like it used to, but the functionality of tflint has changed.

**Nice to have**

**Additional context**
I realize this isn't a gruntwork problem pre-se, but there are other pre-commit hooks that do handle this.

We are encountering this issue as well, where the `.tflint` file in the root of a project used to be read in and used by pre-commit for files in subfolders, but now that config is ignored.

We confirmed that moving the base `.tflint` file into any affected project subfolder remedied the issue for files in that specific folder. Not a solution, per se, but another data point that `chdir` is at work here.

Experiencing the same issue as @brycelowe .

Hope this gets fixed soon as we cannot keep copying `.tflint.hcl` into so many subdirectories.

I proposed a fix but I haven't heard anything on my PR.
