**Describe the solution you'd like**
The terraform lock file is causing issues with terraform validate being run in an automated job.  Terraform init is updating the hashes in the lockfile and thus failing the job because it detects changes were made to files.

For now this can be fixed by not checking in the lock file but this is outside of what hashicorp is recommending.

@scbunn This is a very late answer but I faced the same problems. What helped me fix it was running
```
terraform providers lock -platform=linux_amd64 -platform=windows_amd64
```
This adds all hashes for these two platforms to the lock file. It's also describe at the end of the section https://www.terraform.io/language/files/dependency-lock#new-provider-package-checksums
