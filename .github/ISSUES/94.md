**Describe the solution you'd like**
I don't want to see these warnings
```
WARNING: "tflint FILE/DIR" is deprecated and will error in a future version. Use --chdir or --filter instead.
```

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Stop using `gruntwork-io/pre-commit`. Don't really want to go there.
Downgrade `tflint`. Don't want to do that either.

**Additional context**
tflint release notes on deprecation - https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/releases/tag/v0.46.0
Tested with `gruntwork-io/pre-commit` v0.1.19

Hi @lukasz-mitka! With the merging of PR #92, new functionality was added that allows you to pass arguments directly to tflint. This was included in release [v0.1.21](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/releases/tag/v0.1.21). Can you take a look and see if this resolves the issue you're having, since it will allow you to pass `--filter` directly?

@gcagle3 that could work, but I was hoping for out of the box solution.

@lukasz-mitka that makes sense, thank you. We'll work to get PR #95 updated with the changes from #92 so we can add this functionality.

This has been merged and is now available in release [v0.1.22](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/releases/tag/v0.1.22).
