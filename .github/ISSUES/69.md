# tflint support for cloud block in terraform

**freimer** commented *Jan 24, 2022*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Need support for the cloud stanza in the terraform block.  See https://www.terraform.io/cli/cloud/settings Currently it errors out saying cloud is an "Unsupported block type" so we have to disable tflint

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
There are no alternatives, other than disabling tflint

**Additional context**
This is relatively new syntax from HashiCorp, but it does need to be addressed.

This is actually supported with the latest version of tflint.  I suppose my question is if there is a way to have pre-commit or this repo automatically update, or update if told to do so, the hooks included.  We can specify the rev for this repo, but what about the hook ids?  I'm just not aware of how to do this if that is even possible, or whether the individual tools like tflint need to be manually updated.  Will close this issue, as I don't think it is an issue with this repo, but if anyone knows I'd be interested.
