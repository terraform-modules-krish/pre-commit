**Describe the bug**
Unable to provide my own configuration to markdown-link-check via pre-commit

**To Reproduce**

**Expected behavior**
I added the `markdown-link-check` hook to my `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and ran `pre-commit run -a` but found that private links I'm trying to check give a 503. For my case, I am trying to check markdown in a private Gitlab repo. I found I can add a cookie header to the config in order to grant the tool access to check these links if I run `markdown-link-check -c config.json README.md` but if try to do it by adding `-c config.json` to the `args` as below in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, then `markdown-link-check` fails to run properly and throws an error about the configuration:

```
  - id: markdown-link-check
    args:
    - -c config.json
```

So I did some checking and I found the script creates its own temp config and provides the `-c` flag itself to `markdown-link-check`, which seems to conflict with my -c flag in the args.

**Nice to have**
- [ ] Terminal output
- [ ] Screenshots

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

I have also run into this issue where I need to pass in a configuration file in order to set Authorization headers. Would love to have this updated to reflect `markdown-link-check`'s inherent functionality!
