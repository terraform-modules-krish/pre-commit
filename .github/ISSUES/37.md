Would be great if tfsec would also be supported to do some static security scanning of the code: https://github.com/liamg/tfsec

Hey @brikis98,
think that goes into the same direction as #38 
The use-case seems to be better suited by:
1) Creating terraform modules and configuration in git repos and checking the code with sth. like (https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform)
2) Creating Terragrunt-code pulling the terraform code in and checking that with this pre-commit variation.
