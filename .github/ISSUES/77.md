**Describe the bug**
helmlint doesn't really lint

the folder structure looks like 

```
tree test-hook
test-hook
└── test
    ├── Chart.yaml
    ├── charts
    ├── templates
    │   ├── NOTES.txt
    │   ├── _helpers.tpl
    │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   ├── hpa.yaml
    │   ├── ingress.yaml
    │   ├── service.yaml
    │   ├── serviceaccount.yaml
    │   └── tests
    │       └── test-connection.yaml
    └── values.yaml

4 directories, 10 files
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior including the relevant Terraform/Terragrunt/Packer version number and any code snippets and module inputs you used.

a default `helm lint test` run looks like

```hcl
helm lint test 
==> Linting test
[INFO] Chart.yaml: icon is recommended
[ERROR] values.yaml: unable to parse YAML: error converting YAML to JSON: yaml: line 79: did not find expected key
[ERROR] templates/: cannot load values.yaml: error converting YAML to JSON: yaml: line 79: did not find expected key
[ERROR] : unable to load chart
        cannot load values.yaml: error converting YAML to JSON: yaml: line 79: did not find expected key

Error: 1 chart(s) linted, 1 chart(s) failed
```

But the pre-commit run looks like

```HCL
pre-commit run --all-files
helmlint.................................................................Passed
```

here is the pre-commit config

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit
    rev: v0.1.17 # Get the latest from: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/releases
    hooks:
      - id: helmlint

```
**Expected behavior**
The helmlint should give the same result as helm lint

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

`pre-commit run --all-files -verbose` shows this

`.cache/pre-commit/repoz_8jwzgx/hooks/helmlint.sh: line 68: realpath: command not found`

After installing the package the **problem is resolved**, the getting started doc should add this as a dependency. 

`brew install coreutils`
