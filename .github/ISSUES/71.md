# Helmlint: support for multiple Value files

**davidlukac** commented *Feb 23, 2022*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
To manage multiple environment tiers we often have base `values.yaml` file and then environment specific files:
- `values.dev.yaml`,
- `values.uat.yaml`,
- `values.prod.yaml`,
etc. These are then used as e.g.
```
helm upgrade myApp . -f values.prod.yaml
```
The Helm linter has a support for the same arguments:
```
helm lint . -f values.prod.yaml
```
It would be great if the `helmlint` pre-commit hook would support a list of `values.yaml` files as well.
