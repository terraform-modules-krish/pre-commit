## Description

### Problem

When using [`tfenv`](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv), `terraform` executable might resolve to different Terraform versions, depending on the directory where it runs (e.g. via using [`.terraform-version`](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv#terraform-version-file) files).
At the moment, the `terraform-fmt` check runs `terraform fmt` from the repository root, and in some cases (e.g. when  all Terraform configuration along with `.terraform-version` is in a subfolder) it might even mean that no valid Terraform version is configured.

### Proposed solution

For `terraform-fmt` check, switch to the directory of the Terraform file we're checking (similarly to what happens in [terraform-hclfmt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/blob/master/hooks/terragrunt-hclfmt.sh#L11-L13) and [terraform-validate](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/blob/master/hooks/terraform-validate.sh#L18-L21) checks). This will ensure that the right Terraform version is picked up if tools like `tfenv` are used. 

### Documentation

<!--
  If this is a feature PR, then where is it documented?

  - If docs exist:
    - Update any references, if relevant.
  - If no docs exist:
    - Create a stub for documentation including bullet points for how to use the feature, code snippets (including from happy path tests), etc.

<!-- Important: Did you make any backward incompatible changes? If yes, then you must write a migration guide! -->
