# Shellcheck optionals

**06kellyjac** commented *May 11, 2020*

Added the ability to use optional shellcheck checks.

Testing Script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

yo="a"
[ -z "$yo" ]

which ls
```

Testing pre-commit config:

```yaml
---
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: shellcheck
        name: Shellcheck Bash Linter
        description: Performs linting on bash scripts
        entry: ../pre-commit/hooks/shellcheck.sh
        language: script
        # args: ["--enable require-variable-braces,deprecate-which"] # comment and uncomment
```

---

logging the command that would be ran, forcing exit 1 to show the logs:

With:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
Shellcheck Bash Linter...................................................Failed
- hook id: shellcheck
- exit code: 1

shellcheck --enable="require-variable-braces,deprecate-which" "sample.sh"

In sample.sh line 4:
[ -z "$yo" ]
      ^-^ SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references even when not strictly required.
...
...
```

Without:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
Shellcheck Bash Linter...................................................Failed
- hook id: shellcheck
- exit code: 1

shellcheck "sample.sh"
```

`--enable` will only be ran if it's provided in the pre-commit config. This is to avoid issues with shellcheck before 0.7.0 when `--enable` was added

I've updated the regex used for the shebang & file ending as shellcheck should match the following shells:

* `sh`
* `ash`
* `dash`
* `bash`
* `bats`
* `ksh`
[src](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/c2a15ce8e906ae6a12bcbe32eac7ac586fbcb59b/src/ShellCheck/Parser.hs#L3186-L3193)

---

Shebang regex:
Was: `'^#!.*sh'`
Now: `'^#!\(/\|/.*/\|/.* \)\(\(ba\|da\|k\|a\)*sh\|bats\)$'`

Test cases:
https://pastebin.com/BKB92wx2

Previous regex matched a lot of invalid shebangs & missed the 6 valid `bats` shebangs.

Current regex matches just the 6 correct shebangs from each valid shell.
There are probably some cases that I can't think of but it's a lot safer than the existing one.
A compromise would be something like: `'^#!/.*\(\(ba\|da\|k\|a\)*sh\|bats\)$'`
It matches the `zsh` `fish` and extra characters + valid shell ones but they're all at least valid.

---

File ending regex:
Was: `\.sh$|bash$`
Now: `.+\.(sh|bash|dash|ksh|ash|bats)$`

Test cases:
https://pastebin.com/JRJg8N13

Testing script:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
test() {
	if [[ "$1" =~ .+\.(sh|bash|dash|ksh|ash|bats)$ ]]; then
		echo "match     - $1"
	else
		echo "not match - $1"
	fi
}

while IFS= read -r FILE; do
	if [[ "$FILE" != "" ]]; then
		test "$FILE"
	fi
done <<EOF
TEST CASES HERE
EOF
```

Previous regex would match `.sh` `bash` and miss `file.ksh` `file.dash` `file.ash` `file.bats`

Current regex only matches the 3 normal file names + also matches just `.sh` `.bash` etc, which are very unusual but valid file names.
There's no extra checking for slashes etc because file names & escapes could confuse things, just the extension should be enough.

No problem

> tabbing should be 2 spaces
Ahh. I think the original changes had 2 spaces. I think I ran `shfmt` at some point or something

> the while loop should use `$# -gt 0`
The google style guide says it's fine to use `(( ))` in the testing strings section, and focuses on `(( ))` in the arithmetic section. But it's up to you :)

`shellcheck` actually flags this because `$#` is a number, not a string, so you need to use `-gt` not `>`.

`SC2071` only complains about the use of `>` and `<` within `[[ ]]`

`(( ))` can only handle numbers and shellcheck has no issues

Using `-gt` doesn't work with `(( ))` and causes the following shellcheck issues

Ahhh I think you are right. Apologies for that! I was so used to switching to `[[]]` everywhere I think I missed the first pass of shellcheck.

no problem :smiley:
~I'll pop in a PR swapping back to spaces soon~ ah you've got one already, nice
