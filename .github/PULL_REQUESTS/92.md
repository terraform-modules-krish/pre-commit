## Description
While I was trying to disable some rules for tflint at specific locations I realized that I needed to use `args` because having a .tflint.hcl wasn't an option for my project structure. Here is the support for args.
```console
$ tflint -v
TFLint version 0.44.1
+ ruleset.terraform (0.2.2-bundled)

$ tf version
Terraform v1.3.8
```

```yaml
  - id: tflint
    name: Terraform lint (gcp project level)
    files: ^gcp/[\w_\-]+/[\w_\-]+\.tf$
    args: [--disable-rule=terraform_required_providers]
```

@msgongora It looks like the build is failing because your fork is missing some updated pipeline changes from commit 5341f388c2a962d3bc66e075f00b80ab45b15f24. Could you rebase and pull in the latest changes into your fork? That should resolve the build failure and allow this to proceed.
