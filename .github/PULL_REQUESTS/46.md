# Update terraform-fmt to match terraform-validate

**brikis98** commented *Dec 9, 2020*

This PR updates the `terraform-fmt` hook as follows:

1. Run with `-diff -check` so the differences are printed, rather than made on disk.
1. Instead of exiting on the first error, save the exit codes, and print out all `fmt` errors before exiting.

These changes are very similar to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/pull/45.

What was the reason for adding `-check`? It was kind of nice having it automatically format the tf code for you instead of someone manually making the changes that need to be made?
