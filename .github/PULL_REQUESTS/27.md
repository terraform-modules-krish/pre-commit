# Reformat shellcheck.sh to style guide

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 2, 2020*

This makes the following updates to update the style of shellcheck.sh:

- switch `\t` to `  `
- avoid using global variables
- use lowercase var names for local vars
- `>` => `-gt`
- fixes a bug in the argument parser which was not handling the enable list correctly. It was missing a second shift when it read in the second arg for the case of `shellcheck.sh --enable foo bar.sh`.
