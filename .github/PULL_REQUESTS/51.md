# Add tfsec

**Jeiwan** commented *May 18, 2021*

This PR adds [tfsec](https://github.com/tfsec/tfsec) as a hook.

Since `tfsec` works with folders, not files, I had to extract directory paths from file paths. `uniq` removes duplicate paths, and `require_serial: true` disables parallelism and also reduces duplicates eventually.

Tested with `pre-commit try-repo`.
