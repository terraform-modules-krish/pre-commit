# Helm pre commit

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 6, 2019*

Introduces a precommit hook for running `helm lint`.

Note: I will be merging in and releasing this immediately because I have confirmed it is working in a few manual tests, but would still like a review since I am not as strong in bash. This is to say that there is no time pressure in reviewing this PR.

Opened https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/pull/8 to address the suggestions here.

macos bash doesn't have `realpath` so sadly helmlint is not usable there. I just tried it.
