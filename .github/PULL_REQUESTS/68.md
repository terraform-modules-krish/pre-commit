# Change the way `go fmt` is executed

**gchappel** commented *Jan 20, 2022*

Since `$@` contains a filtered list of all `*.go` files that are staged for the commit, calling `go fmt` on them individually stops the error being thrown when trying to run `go fmt` against a subdirectory, from a directory which does not contain a `go.mod` file
