# Fix terraform fmt hook where it is now running on all files regardless of exclude

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 6, 2020*

This fixes a bug with our terraform fmt hook that was introduced in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/pull/15.

Specifically, `terraform fmt -r` ignores the exclude configuration. This makes it hard for our repos that are testing malformed terraform files as they will never pass the `terraform fmt` precommit hook.

Instead, we go through each file to run through `terraform fmt`.
