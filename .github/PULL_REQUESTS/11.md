# Fix incorrect shebang detection

**macbutch** commented *Feb 18, 2019*

The Shellcheck hook incorrectly detects shebangs for [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) as being shell scripts. These are not handled by shellcheck and lead to the checks failing (when they should not).

The shebang for .bats files looks like this:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bats
```

The attached pull request fixes the shebang detection for all cases where it's relevant to me; I can't think of a reasonable breakage case but let me know if you see problems.

@brikis98 I tested this by editing the file in place in my environment and re-running the checks. It still detects my other shell files and excludes `.bats`. I'm not sure of a better way to test.

I can't think of a shell shebang that this won't match but it is more restrictive. What I've changed it to is probably the original intention unless, maybe, there should be a $ at the end as well. (i.e. check that it starts with `#!` and ends with `sh`). Happy to submit changes if you like.
