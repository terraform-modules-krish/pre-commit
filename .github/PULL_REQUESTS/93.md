## Description

Adds a new [`golangci-lint`](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) hook in the Gruntwork script style and marks `golint`  as deprectated. **Why?**  [`golint`](https://github.com/golang/lint) is frozen and deprecated. [`golangci-lint`](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) is quite popular and is capable of running multiple linting tools.

### Minor

This PR also fixes the [failing ci](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/pre-commit?branch=feature%2Fgolangci-lint) so the tests pass.

### Documentation

Updated README.md to describe the new hook.
