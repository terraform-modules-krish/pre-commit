# Markdown link check

**yorinasub17** commented *Feb 4, 2020*

This is a pre-commit hook that can be used to check links on markdown docs, using the npm package [markdown-link-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-link-check).

There is (https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/asciidoc-link-check), but it looks to have less users and is missing a few features that the md version has. I was planning on contributing a few more features before that one is ready.

Going to merge and release this one for now!
