@yorinasub17 Sorry for the inconvenience, you are totally right. I did this way because I had to refer to the overall changes in my project somehow. But it's kind of selfish, there is no excuse for me. I'll split them up carefully.

No worries! That was just a request.

The workflow I use is to commit each change set individually (using `git add -p`), then create branches for each change and use `git cherry-pick`. That way, I have a branch with everything, but also the split versions. For a small number of change sets, it works well. It can be tedious with lots of changes though.

Another approach is to work backwards:

- Have a branch with all the commits
- Create new branches for each change set to turn into PR from the combined branch
- Use `git rebase -i` to drop the irrelevant commits from each subbranch.

You'll need to resolve the conflict now that I merged the `terraform-validate` PR.
