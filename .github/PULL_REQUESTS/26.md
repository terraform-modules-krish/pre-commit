# Support tfenv+tgenv

**AlainODea** commented *May 18, 2020*

Invoke terraform and terragrunt from the directory of the file being checked. This allows **tfenv** and **tgenv** to load the correct versions of terraform and terragrunt in a mixed-version repository.

This is for the same reasons as gruntwork-io/module-ci#150:
> tfenv loads the correct terraform version based on a file called .terraform_version in the present working directory. Prior to this change, terraform-update-variable would use the root of the cloned repo as the present working directory and select a potentially incompatible version of terraform.
