# Store and return last failure from validate vs exit on first failure

**davidalger** commented *Dec 7, 2020*

This PR accomplishes two things:

* Cleans up output on terraform-validate adding informative marker indicating directory in which a failure occurred, which is crucial when running this in CI against a repository with a dozen or more modules.
* Updates terraform-validate to correctly check each argument passed in by pre-commit rather than exiting on the first failure encountered.

Here's what I did to test this:

a) Added the following to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and then run `pre-commit install` in a local checkout of a terraform module:

```
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/davidalger/pre-commit
    rev: "a787da3a8"
    hooks:
      - id: terraform-fmt
      - id: terraform-validate
```
Can also be done via HEAD referencing local checkout:
```
repos:
  - repo: ~/Work/pre-commit
    rev: "HEAD"
    hooks:
      - id: terraform-fmt
      - id: terraform-validate
```

b) Run pre-commit on all files with intentionally bad code:

```
$ pre-commit run --all-files
Terraform fmt............................................................Passed
Terraform validate.......................................................Failed
- hook id: terraform-validate
- exit code: 1

--> Running 'terraform validate' in directory '.'

- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v3.20.0
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/template v2.2.0

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

* hashicorp/aws: version = "~> 3.20.0"
* hashicorp/template: version = "~> 2.2.0"

Success! The configuration is valid.

Tests passed! Merging now.

Ah, I just realized we should apply similar changes to the `terraform-fmt` hook too: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/pull/46
