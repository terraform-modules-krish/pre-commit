# Initialise tflint to install plugins

**pauloconnor** commented *Oct 27, 2021*

If `.tflint.hcl` has any plugins defined, the pre-commit hook will fail without human intervention. That's less than ideal when pre-commits are thought to be self contained, so initialise the plugins on each run. If they're installed, it's a single output line.
