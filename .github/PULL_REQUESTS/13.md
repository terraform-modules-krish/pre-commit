# Fix gofmt hook

**yorinasub17** commented *May 8, 2019*

This fixes the `gofmt` hook. The main issue is that this is using a relative path without the prefix `./`, which throws off go because it will look for the package in `GOPATH` directly, as opposed to treating it like a file package in the current directory.
