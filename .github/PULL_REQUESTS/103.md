## Description

When operating in a monorepo the new functionality of tflint (`--chdir`) breaks config file path by changing the current working directory when tflint runs.  This commit patches this gap by allowing a user to provide __GIT_ROOT__ or populate a environment variable with a custom string and when the `--config` argument is is found it replaces that keyword with the repository root (pwd in the case of pre-commit).

I've also re-positioned the init call and passed the arguments to it as it simply looked for the default `.tflint.hcl`.

### Documentation

<!--
  If this is a feature PR, then where is it documented?

  - If docs exist:
    - Update any references, if relevant.
  - If no docs exist:
    - Create a stub for documentation including bullet points for how to use the feature, code snippets (including from happy path tests), etc.
-->
I've updated the README.md with the caveats that this introduces and how to use it.
