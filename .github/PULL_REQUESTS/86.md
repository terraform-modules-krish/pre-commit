# Ignore hash links

**endrec** commented *Oct 28, 2022*

## Description

Validation of links to internal anchors was introduced to [`markdown-link-check`](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check) in v3.10. Unfortunately this does not work with anchors created by HTML anchor tags, which is commonly used.
This change makes `markdown-link-check` ignore these links, which was the behaviour in previous versions.
